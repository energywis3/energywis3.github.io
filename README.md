We are working on a project called energywise. This consumer-facing application (web/mobile) for your everyday household with a personal electric vehicle is considering having a household EV charger.
Currently, EV charging market is very fragmented, and it is dawting for new customers who are looking to get the best deal and function that is fit for their house. energywise provides the solution by using a quick survey to assess the best charging model/provider for the customer's needs. We also act as a platform where people can easily order and manage/maintain their EV chargers. Think of it like Check24 + Booking.com for household EV charging stations.

What we want to know:
- How does the EV charging industry function, and what are the main challenges from the company's perspective?
- What is the current situation (supply, demand, etc.) regarding EV charger engineers who maintain the charger?
- How does the operation look like from the company perspective when a customer orders a household charger from a company?
- Any other information that could help us integrate the salesforce, maintenance, and other operations of the EV charger provider with a third-party service (ex: what information is needed to operate, how to source engineers, is there a demand for a service like this from the provider side?)
